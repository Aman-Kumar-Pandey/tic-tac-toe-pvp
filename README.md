# Tic Tac Toe – Two players

A lightweight, browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built entirely with vanilla web technologies, without relying on external libraries or frameworks. The project focuses on clear structure, readable logic, and direct interaction with the DOM, making it easy to inspect, modify, and extend.

The game runs fully offline, adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, and can be played instantly in any modern browser. Its versioning style make it ideal for learning through iteration, experimentation, and controlled breakage—because breaking things is how real understanding forms.

⚠️ Note: This is a purely client-side project. Minor bugs, edge cases, or logic gaps may exist by design, serving as opportunities for exploration, debugging, and improvement.
